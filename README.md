# Onyx-Data-Challenge-August
Data Challenge Regarding Gym Membership


🏋️‍♂️ Customer Retention & Revenue Optimization Dashboard

This repository contains the work I did for the Onyx Data DNA Challenge (August 2025).
The goal was to analyze a Fitness Membership dataset to uncover insights around customer retention, resource utilization, and revenue optimization.

📂 Repository Contents
data/ → Dataset provided for the challenge
scripts/ → Python scripts for preprocessing and exploratory analysis
dashboard/ → Power BI file (.pbix) containing interactive dashboard
images/ → Screenshots of dashboard tabs

📊 Dashboard Highlights

1. Retention Tab

>Recency-based segmentation of members into Active, Low Risk, High Risk, and Likely Churn.
>Intervention strategies for each segment:
>>>Active → Ask for referrals
>>>Low Risk (30–45 days) → Proactive contact
>>>High Risk (45–60 days) → Targeted discounts
>>>Likely churn (>60 days) → Personalized reactivation offers

2. Resource Utilization Tab
   
Heatmaps of peak gym usage hours (10, 11, 13, 14, 17 hrs).
Insights into gender preferences & program-specific peaks (Sauna, Training, Group Sessions).
Location analysis: Fresno, Long Beach, and Sacramento as key hubs.

4. Revenue Optimization Tab

Premium memberships & monthly payments drive highest average revenue.
Discounts not always effective → possible poor targeting or competitive pricing.
Females contribute slightly higher avg revenue.
Scatterplot analysis: High-risk members = most price-sensitive.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Power BI → Dashboard creation, bookmarks, RFM segmentation, scatterplots
Python → Data preprocessing, exploratory analysis
Pandas, Matplotlib → Additional checks & transformations
